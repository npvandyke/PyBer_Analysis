# PyBer_Analysis

Analysis of PyBer's ride sharing data from January through May 2019. 

# Overview of the analysis:

This project utilized Python, along with the packages Pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy, to analyze all ride sharing data for the company PyBer from January through May 2019. Differences in the data between three types of cities (urban, suburban and rural) have been summarized in order that those differences may inform decision makers at PyBer.

# Results:

Included above is a bubble chart displaying the total number of rides and the average ride fare per city in 2019. The data is color-coded to represent three different city types: urban, suburban and rural, with the bubble sizes correlating with the number of drivers per city. As can be infered from the chart, urban cities trended toward having the greatest total number of rides in 2019 as well as the greatest number of drivers, followed by suburban and then rural cities. Conversely, rural cities trended toward having the most expensive average ride fare, followed by suburban and then urban cities. This is not surprising given that trips in rural areas are most likely a longer distance on average than in urban or suburban areas. The relatively higher average ride fare for rural cities may also reflect a company strategy to compensate for the fewer number of rides in such areas. 

The box-and-whiskers plots below display the same per-city data amalgamated by city type. The trends that were clear from viewing the bubble chart, including the increasing cost of ride fare from urban to suburban and rural city types, and the decreasing total number of drivers from urban to suburban and rural city types, are reaffirmed when viewing the medians of the data displayed in both plots below. 

The box-and-whiskers plots also reveal a much greater variation in the total number of drivers per city for urban city types than for suburban or rural city types, suggesting perhaps a greater variation in the size of urban cities or in the number of ride requests per urban city.

Next we have three pie charts that display the percentages by city type of the total ride fare generated in 2019, the total number of rides in 2019 and the total number of drivers in 2019. Here we see that while urban city types tended to have the lowest-set ride fare, they still managed to generate the most total fare in 2019 due to having a greater total number of rides. It is unclear from the given data how much of profit from ride fares per city type is offset by the number of drivers per city type, but we can see that with an increased percentage of total fare by city type comes an increased percentage of total number of drivers. 

| Total Fare in 2019 | Number of Rides in 2019 | Number of Drivers in 2019

Finally, the line graph below gives us a clear, high level picture of the total fares generated by each city type over the course of several months in 2019. Here the data becomes evident that despite the higher average ride fare in rural and suburban cities, urban city types consistently genererated the highest total fare. The lower average ride fare cost in urban areas was more than compensated for by the higher total number of rides.

# Summary:

Based on the analysis of the data presented above, here are some business recommendations for the CEO of PyBer to consider, which address the disparities in the data found among city types: 

1. PyBer could try adding more drivers to rural cities, which are the city type with the fewest number of drivers and the highest average fare per ride. It could be the case that there are not currently enough drivers to meet the number of ride requests in rural cities, in which scenario there is potential untapped revenue to be had by adding enough drivers to fulfill all ride requests in rural cities. 

2. PyBer may be able to assign fewer drivers in urban cities. While urban drivers accounted for 86.7% of the total number PyBer drivers in 2019, urban cities only accounted for 68.4% of the number of rides through PyBer in that same period. It may be the case that urban cities are saturated with more drivers than necessary for the number of requested rides, in which case the company could cut expenses by cutting or relocating surplus urban drivers. 

3. PyBer could increase the fare per ride in urban and suburban cities. Its unclear if the company currently ties cost per ride to distance or to other factors, but with urban and suburban city types accounting for far more of the total rides in 2019 than rural city types, increasing cost per ride in urban and suburban areas to be comparable with the higher ride costs in rural areas could generate a lot more revenue for PyBer.
